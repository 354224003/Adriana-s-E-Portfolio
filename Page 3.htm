  <h3><a href="factsheet.jpg">The Googley Choice Adventure - Fact Sheet</a></h3>
 <p class="big">This artifact is a good example of my design and business communication skills. The way that I designed the poster shows my design skills because it is well organized, bright and interesting to look at. It also shows my communication skills because of how I was able to communicate the point of the sheet in a way that catches the eye of my co - workers and makes them want to read on. This will help me to move on in the business world because it will allow employers to see that I am able to design important documents for the company if need and demonstrates my highly developed business communication skills. This connects to the Catholic Graduate Expectation and Social teaching of a collaborative contributor who finds meaning, dignity and vocation in work which respects the rights of all and contributes to the common good. This is shown through the contribution of my design and communication skills to the business world and my future employers.

  <h3><a href="BTT101 - Story .docx">Components of a Computer Story</a></h3>
  <p class="big">
This artifact is a good example of my creativity. This is shown as I was able to take a piece of hardware that seems pretty boring on its own and make it interesting by telling a story. This will help me as I move forward because it helps people see that I am creative which is something that employers look for. This connects to the Catholic Graduate Expectation and Social teaching of a reflective, creative and holistic thinker who solves problems and makes responsible decisions with an informed moral conscience for the common good. This is shown in my artifact through the creativity of my story and how I used the talents that God gave me to spread information and help people learn in a more interesting way. </p>

  <h3><a href="BTT101 - Hardware - Adriana.docx">Harware T-Chart</a></h3>
  <p class="big">This artifact is a good example of my responsibility and organizational skills. This artifact demonstrates this because it is an example of one of the things I used to study for my test. This shows my responsibility as it highlights that I care about my work and will do my best. It also shows my organizational skills because it is very clearly arranged. This will help me in the future because it allows others to see that I am responsible and when they ask me to do something I will do it and get it back to them in an organized and professional way. This connects to the  Catholic Graduate Expectation and Social teaching of a self-directed, responsible, lifelong learner who develops and demonstrates their God-given potential. This is shown in my artifact because it is well done work that is neat showing that I am responsible and will do my best work demonstrating my God-given potential.</p>

  <h3><a href="Business Letter.docx">Business Letter</a></h3>
  <p class="big">This artifact is a good example of my business communication skills. This is demonstrated through the effectiveness of my letter. It is a clear and professional letter showing that my business communication is very highly developed. This will help me as I move forward because it demonstrates to employers that I know how to interact in a company and that I am thoroughly prepared to enter the workforce. This connects to the Catholic Graduate Expectation and Social teaching of an effective communicator, who speaks, writes and listens honestly and sensitively, responding critically in light of gospel values. This is shown in my artifact through the professional and kind way that I communicated. The conciseness of it shows that I am able to effectively communicate easily.</p>

  <p class="big">

This artifact is a good example of my attention to detail. This is shown through the formulas that I had to create. The formulas are often very specific and one little mistake can mess the whole thing up. However, I was able to get it right showing that I have good attention to detail. This will help me in the future because it shows employers that when I do my work, I do it carefully and take notice of the details to ensure that the work is well done. This is a valuable skill that many employers would jump at therefore it would help me in future jobs. This artifact was a learning experience for me that will help me to connect to the Catholic Graduate Expectation and Social teaching of A caring family member who attends to family, school, parish, and the wider community.</p>

  <h3><a href="Screencastify Presentation.pdf">Screencastify Presentation</a></h3>
  <p class="big">This artifact is a good example of my teamwork skills. In this artifact, I had to work with my peers in order to create a presentation that talks about the benefits of Screencastify. You can see through the quality of our presentation that we were able to work together well, demonstrating that I am a good team player, the same as my other group members. This will help me as I move forward because it shows employers that I am easy to work with and will benefit their company by interacting with co-workers. This is a skill that employers look for and will want to hire me when they see that I work well with others. This connects to the Catholic Graduate Expectation and Social teaching of a collaborative contributor who finds meaning, dignity and vocation in work which respects the rights of all and contributes to the common good. This is shown through the team effort that was put into this project and how I listened to my peers and worked with them to create something great.</p>

  <h3><a href="https://354224003.wixsite.com/my-site-1/user-agreement">Stars Music Warehouse Website</a></h3>
  <p class="big">This artifact is a good example of my self control and responsibility. This is shown through the difficulty of making a website and the product that I came up with. Making a website is not an easy task; it was especially difficult for me as it was my first time making one. However, the fact that I was able to work hard on it shows that I have self control because I was able to create a website to the best of my abilities even when I didn’t really want to work on it. It also shows that I am responsible and will not just give up because I want to do something else. This connects to the Catholic Graduate Expectation and Social teaching of a self-directed, responsible, lifelong learner who develops and demonstrates their God-given potential. This is shown through my responsibility of working hard to create a website by myself and shows that when I do my work it will be good. </p>
